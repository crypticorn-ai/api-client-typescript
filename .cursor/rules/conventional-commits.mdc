commit_message
- Always follow the Conventional Commits specification: 
  https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
- Format must be: <type>(<scope>): <short description>
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- Scope is optional but recommended (e.g., feat(api): ...).
- Use imperative mood in the description (e.g., "add" not "added" or "adds").
- Keep subject line under 72 characters.
- If necessary, add a blank line after the subject and include a longer body.
- Body should explain *what* and *why*, not *how*.
- Use bullet points for multiple changes in the body.
- Reference issues/tickets in the footer when applicable (e.g., "Closes #123").

examples

- "fix(api): handle null pointer in user response"
- "docs(readme): update installation instructions"

- "test(router): add integration tests for nested routes"
